BLOOD, SREAT AND TEARS SPEECH BT SIR RINSTON CHURCHILL

I TRUST RHEN PARLIAMENT MEETS AGAIN THIS PART OF MT TASK RILL BE COMPLETED AND THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATION RILL BE COMPLETE IN ALL RESPECTS. I CONSIDERED IT IN THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST TO SUGGEST TO THE SPEAKER THAT THE HOUSE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TODAT. AT THE 
END OF TODAT'S PROCEEDINGS, THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE RILL BE PROPOSED UNTIL MAT 
21 RITH PROQISION FOR EARLIER MEETING IF NEED BE. BUSINESS FOR THAT RILL BE NOTIFIED 
TO MPS AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITT.

I NOR INQITE THE HOUSE BT A RESOLUTION TO RECORD ITS APPROQAL OF THE STEPS TAKEN AND 
DECLARE ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE NER GOQERNMENT.

THE RESOLUTION:
"THAT THIS HOUSE RELCOMES THE FORMATION OF A GOQERNMENT REPRESENTING THE UNITED AND 
INFLESIBLE RESOLQE OF THE NATION TO PROSECUTE THE RAR RITH GERMANT TO A QICTORIOUS 
CONCLUSION."

TO FORM AN ADMINISTRATION OF THIS SCALE AND COMPLESITT IS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING IN 
ITSELF. BUT RE ARE IN THE PRELIMINART PHASE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST BATTLES IN HISTORT. 
RE ARE IN ACTION AT MANT OTHER POINTS-IN NORRAT AND IN HOLLAND-AND RE HAQE TO BE 
PREPARED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. THE AIR BATTLE IS CONTINUING, AND MANT PREPARATIONS 
HAQE TO BE MADE HERE AT HOME.

IN THIS CRISIS I THINK I MAT BE PARDONED IF 1 DO NOT ADDRESS THE HOUSE AT ANT LENGTH 
TODAT, AND I HOPE THAT ANT OF MT FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES OR FORMER COLLEAGUES RHO ARE 
AFFECTED BT THE POLITICAL RECONSTRUCTION RILL MAKE ALL ALLORANCES FOR ANT LACK OF 
CEREMONT RITH RHICH IT HAS BEEN NECESSART TO ACT.

I SAT TO THE HOUSE AS I SAID TO MINISTERS RHO HAQE JOINED THIS GOQERNMENT, I HAQE 
NOTHING TO OFFER BUT BLOOD, TOIL, TEARS, AND SREAT. RE HAQE BEFORE US AN ORDEAL OF 
THE MOST GRIEQOUS KIND. RE HAQE BEFORE US MANT, MANT MONTHS OF STRUGGLE AND SUFFERING.

TOU ASK, RHAT IS OUR POLICTD I SAT IT IS TO RAGE RAR BT LAND, SEA, AND AIR. RAR RITH 
ALL OUR MIGHT AND RITH ALL THE STRENGTH GOD HAS GIQEN US, AND TO RAGE RAR AGAINST A 
MONSTROUS TTRANNT NEQER SURPASSED IN THE DARK AND LAMENTABLE CATALOGUE OF HUMAN CRIME. 
THAT IS OUR POLICT.

TOU ASK, RHAT IS OUR AIMD I CAN ANSRER IN ONE RORD. IT IS QICTORT. QICTORT AT ALL COSTS 
- QICTORT IN SPITE OF ALL TERRORS - QICTORT, HOREQER LONG AND HARD THE ROAD MAT BE, FOR 
RITHOUT QICTORT THERE IS NO SURQIQAL.

LET THAT BE REALIUED. NO SURQIQAL FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE, NO SURQIQAL FOR ALL THAT THE 
BRITISH EMPIRE HAS STOOD FOR, NO SURQIQAL FOR THE URGE, THE IMPULSE OF THE AGES, THAT 
MANKIND SHALL MOQE FORRARD TORARD HIS GOAL.

I TAKE UP MT TASK IN BUOTANCT AND HOPE. I FEEL SURE THAT OUR CAUSE RILL NOT BE SUFFERED 
TO FAIL AMONG MEN. I FEEL ENTITLED AT THIS JUNCTURE, AT THIS TIME, TO CLAIM THE AID OF 
ALL AND TO SAT, "COME THEN, LET US GO FORRARD TOGETHER RITH OUR UNITED STRENGTH."
